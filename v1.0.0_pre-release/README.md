# Zabbuino 1.0.0 (pre-release)

####17 Jun 2016

Changes:
- System (internal) metrics (like _sys.vccmin_ / _sys.vccmax_ ) gathering process can be use timer interrupt instead calling sub on every loop. I think this will help to get more reliable results of VCC rising/falling (for example) with sensors that have long-time conversion (like DS18x20). So, that feature may be do system unstable when PWM is used (with _analogWrite[]_ command);
- Code reorganized;

New command:
- _interrupt.count[intPin, intNumber, mode]_. This command allow to get unsigned long counter, that was increased by external interrupt. It's can be used in DYI anemometer projects, for example. On first (after power on) call of _interrupt.count_ command _intPin_ will be switched to INPUT_PULLUP mode and attached to interrupt. On next call number of RISING/FALLING/CHANGE/LOW events will be returned. If _mode_ is changed for _intPin_, that already used by interrupt - counter will be reset and interrupt will be reattached on new _mode_;
  - _intPin_ - which pin used to interrupt catching. For ATMega328p this can be 2 or 3 (refer to https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/AttachInterrupt );
  - _intNumber_ - not used at this time, reserved for future;
  - _mode_ - defines when the interrupt should be triggered. Four constants are predefined as valid values: 0 - LOW, 1 - CHANGE, 2 - FALLING, 3 - RISING

I'm not sure that _interrupt.count_ will be run stable and properly, due not test it in production, but i hope for it.

**Note** You can see unexpected growing of _interrupt.count_ value. It's can be 'button bounce' or 'bad electrical contact' problem.
**Note** Name of _interrupt.count_ can be changed before Zabbuino releasing.

Changes:
- _agent.cmdcount_ renamed to _sys.cmdcount_, because original Zabbix agent haven't _agent.cmdcount_ command;
- numeric arguments can be digital, hexadecimal (C++ _strtoul()_ function was used now for converting); 
- To I2C-sensor-related commands added _I2CAddress_ argument. That need for 2-addresses devices like BH1750. Now _BMP's_ commands is: 
  - _BMP.Temperature[sdaPin, sclPin, i2cAddress]_; 
  - _BMP.Pressure[sdaPin, sclPin, i2cAddress, overSampling]_,

New commands:
- _bh1750.light[sdaPin, sclPin, i2cAddress, mode]_ - return light intensity in _lux_. 
  - i2cAddress: 0x23 or 0x5C; 
  - mode: 0x20 - ONE_TIME_HIGH_RES_MODE, 0x21 - ONE_TIME_HIGH_RES_MODE_2, 0x23 - ONE_TIME_LOW_RES_MODE (refer to datasheet for more details);  
- _i2c.scan[sdaPin, sclPin]_ - return addresses of devices that will be found on I2C bus; 
- _sys.netmodule_ - return netmodule name, that depends on #included library: _W5xxx_ or _ENC28J60_. 

**Note** _bh1750.light_  do not tested with real hardware.

Seems that no dirty hacks with ENC28J60 need. UIPEthernet library have https://github.com/ntruchsess/arduino_uip/tree/fix_errata12 brahch. Its newer that _master_-branch and fix some freezes (may be all?).

Fixed:
- _analogRead[]_ command work was blocked by measureVoltage procedure.

New commands:
- _sys.uptime_ - system working time since power on.

I this time i make test with only W5100 Ethernet Shield only. ENC28J60 testing coming soon. Detailing source code commenting coming soon too.

*UPD:* So, i was upload sketch to second Arduino: Mini Pro + ENC28J60 and make stress test with  _hping3 --flood <ipaddr>_. ENC stops responding to _zabbix\_get_ and another _ping_ session (non-flood). Soon the ENC was re-inited by Zabbuino, non-flood _ping_ and and _zabbix\_get_ works was restored. 

Improvements:
- Network concurrent connections problem fixed. 4 Zabbix item's with 10 sec polling period works good;
- More RAM is free. More Flash is used.

New features:
- Loading and saving network settings (and several other) to EEPROM for remote configuring and changing settings without re-flashing sketch;
- Factory reset button can be connected directly to pins (internal pull-up resistor is used);
- AVR Watchdog support;
- DHCP support;
- Do periodical ENC28J60 init() if no network activity for some time. This action may helps to kick ENC28J60 if that no answer. May be. I hope for it.

New commands:
- _sys.cpuname_ - controller name if known;
- _sys.vcc_ - current VCC (mV);
- _sys.vccmin_ - minimal VCC (mV) for power on time. Gather periodically (~ every  2 sec);
- _sys.vccmax_ - maximal VCC (mV) for power on time. -"-"- ;
- _sethostname[password, hostname]_ - Set and store to EEPROM set new hostname;
- _setpassword[oldPassword, newPassword]_ - Set and store to EEPROM new password;
- _setprotection[password, protection]_ - Store to EEPROM enable / disable password protection flag for _set\*_ and _reboot_ commands;
- _setnetwork[password, useDHCP, macAddress, ipAddress, ipNetmask, ipGateway]_ - Store to EEPROM new network settings. macAddress, ipAddress, ipNetmask, ipGateway is hex-strings. Use http://www.miniwebtool.com/ip-address-to-hex-converter/ to converting from decimal format. Changing useDHCP on fly may be buggy at this time. Need _reboot_ to apply;
- _reboot[password]_ - soft-reboot (_asm: jmp 0_);
- _delay[value]_ - Arduino _delay()_ wrapper;
- _DS18x20.Search[pin]_ - Call OneWire search for Dallas devices, connected to _pin_;


May be something else...
