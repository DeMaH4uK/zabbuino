###v1.1.0 (13 Dec 2016)
Features:
- Network procedures improved;
- Commands can be entered via Arduino IDE Serial Monitor;
- Zabbix can handle Zabbuino directly from Actions;
- Debugging verbosity is splitted to LOW/MIDDLE/HIGH levels;
- EEPROM read/write functions try to detect corruption and try to avoid "broken" cells;
- New MCU metrics (ID, Signature) can be obtained;
- Agent's name/MAC/IP can be gnerated using MCU ID;
- Using ASCII for LCD Character display's commands is allowed;
- Using ASCII for MAX7219 based digital indicators is allowed too;
- WS2812 Led stripe support is implemented;
- PZEM-004 energy meter's metrics can be readed via UART;
- Handling of APC Smart UPS (with RS232 interface) added;
- I2C commands improved;

Important changes:
- Source code is refactored.


###v1.0.0 (15 Aug 2016)
