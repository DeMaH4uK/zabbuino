# Zabbuino
An Zabbix agent firmware for Arduino (**AVR only**)

Actual release is v1.2.0. Compilation tested on Arduino IDE 1.6.11 and above.

All new features can be found on [experimental](https://github.com/zbx-sadman/Zabbuino/tree/experimental) branch. Old releases placed in [old_releases](https://github.com/zbx-sadman/Zabbuino/tree/old_releases) branch.

See [change log](https://github.com/zbx-sadman/Zabbuino/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) before update.

**You can help to the project** by providing new ideas and/or hardware to testing and integrating. Or yo–≥ can just donate for further development. Contact to me via email: [zbx.sadman@gmail.com](mailto://zbx.sadman@gmail.com)
